## Translating

**By submitting translations, you are agreeing to have them licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license.**

You can contribute to the translation effort on our Crowdin [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric)! First you'll need to [register](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register) a Crowdin account if you haven't already. Translators are able to **translate** (submit a translation for an untranslated phrase), **suggest** (propose a better translation compared to an existing one), or **vote** (vote up or down the quality of a translation).

For more information on using Crowdin, please see their "[Intro For Volunteer Translators](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/)" support page.

## FAQ

### A translation(s) uses an offensive phrase. What can I do?

We sincerely apologize. Translations are community submitted, and despite our best efforts, vandalism will occasionally slip through. Please [open an issue](/issues) explaining, and it will be removed as soon as possible.

### How can I suggest a new language to add for translation?

Thank you for your interest! Please [open an issue](#issues) with the [in-game Locale Code](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language#Languages) from the linked table.

### Will you translate Sodium into minority or fictional languages?

Currently this project will not include fictional (e.g. Esperanto), "joke" (e.g. LOLCAT) or minority languages (speakers less than 1 million or insufficient translations in [official Minecraft project](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft)). The reason is simple - these languages are easy to abuse and hard to proofread.
