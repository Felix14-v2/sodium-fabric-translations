## Overview

This repository hosts translations for [**Sodium**](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric), a Minecraft mod designed to improve frame rates and reduce micro-stutter. Please see [the FAQ](#FAQ) for **F**requently **A**sked **Q**uestions and supplimentary information about the project.

For more information, and to discuss this project further, please see [this](https://discord.com/channels/602796788608401408/922250280748335114) thread in [the CaffeineMC discord](https://caffeinemc.net/discord).

## Installation
Translations are provided as a resource pack, and can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/amnotbananaama/sodium-fabric-translations) page. Simply drop the `.zip` file from the latest release into your Minecraft resource pack folder.

If you have never installed a resouce pack before, see [this guide](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Loading_a_resource_pack) on the Minecraft Wiki.

## Translating
**By submitting translations, you are agreeing to have them licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license.**

You can contribute to the translation effort on our Crowdin [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric)! First you'll need to [register](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register) a Crowdin account if you haven't already. Translators are able to **translate** (submit a translation for an untranslated phrase), **suggest** (propose a better translation compared to an existing one), or **vote** (vote up or down the quality of a translation).

For more information on using Crowdin, please see their "[Intro For Volunteer Translators](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/)" support page.

## FAQ

### Why is this a resource pack?

To keep things more organized, we will see where this goes!

### A translation(s) uses an offensive phrase. What can I do?

We sincerely apologize. Translations are community submitted, and despite our best efforts, vandalism will occasionally slip through. Please [open an issue](/issues) explaining, and it will be removed as soon as possible.

### How can I suggest a new language to add for translation?
Thank you for your interest! Please [open an issue](#issues) with the [in-game Locale Code](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language#Languages) from the linked table. We've kept the number of languages relatively small to set a reasonable starting goal, and will add more as requests come in.

### Will you translate Sodium into fictional or "joke" languages?
This project is a volunteer effort with the explicit goal to make Sodium more accessible worldwide. To that end, **we will not be adding or accepting translations for any of the fictional languages Minecraft supports.** As of 1.18, these languages include:
- LOLCAT
- Pirate Speak
- Klingon
- Quenya
- Shakespearean English
- Upside-down English
